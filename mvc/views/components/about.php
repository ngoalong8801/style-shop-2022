                           InStyle is your source for fashion, beauty, celebrity, and lifestyle content that delights,
                           informs, and entertains. If there's a new denim silhouette, you'll find it here â€” as well as
                           a delicate explanation for why it might be stressing people out. We get first dibs on new
                           beauty products and only share what's worth a try, with ingredient breakdowns and
                           step-by-step routines to follow. We question everything and let you know which brands can
                           back up their bona-fides ("clean" and "sustainable" are words that mean things, and we don't
                           let anyone skate past with greenwashed jargon).

                               Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did
                               something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw
                               something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
